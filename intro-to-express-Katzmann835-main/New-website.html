<h1>Nathan's top 5 anticipated places!!!</h1>
<!--First Place-->
<h2>#1: <span><strong>Oregon</strong></span></h2>
<p>I have never been to the state.<br> I would like to visit Mt. Hood, Crater Lake,<span><strong> and </strong></span>visit the coastline.<br>
The trip would involve doing outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, and white water rafting.</p>


<!--Second Place-->
<h2>#2: <span><strong>Israel</strong></span></h2>
<p>This country is supposedly very nice, and a great place to visit <br>
My older brother was there for about a few weeks and had a great time there. <br>
I think it would be cool to visit there and experience what the country has to offer.</p>

<!--Thrid Place-->
<h2>#3: <span><strong>Costa Rica</strong></span></h2>
<p>I was promised a trip there by parents but it never happened.</p>

<!--Fourth Place-->
<h2>#4: <span><strong>Hawaii (Kauai, Maui)</strong></span></h2>

<!--Fifth Place-->
<h2>#5: <span><strong>Alaska (Kenai Pennisula)</strong></span></h2>
