<h1>Nathan's top 5 anticipated places!!!</h1>
<!--First Place-->
<h2>#1: <span><strong>Oregon</strong></span></h2>
<p>I have never been to the state.<br> I would like to visit Mt. Hood, Crater Lake, and visit the coastline.<br>
The trip would involve doing outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, and white water rafting.</p>


<!--Second Place-->
<h2>#2: <span><strong>Israel</strong></span></h2>
<p>This country is supposedly very nice, and a great place to visit. <br>
My older brother was there for about a few weeks and had a great time there. <br>
I think it would be cool to visit there and experience what the country has to offer.</p>


<!--Thrid Place-->
<h2>#3: <span><strong>Costa Rica</strong></span></h2>
<p>I was promised a trip there by parents but it never happened. <br>
    I would like to visit the beaches, volcanoes and national parks of the country. <br>
    I hope to go there at some point in the future.</p>


<!--Fourth Place-->
<h2>#4: <span><strong>Hawaii (Kauai, Maui)</strong></span></h2>
<p>I have been to Hawaii before, but I would be intrested in returning to Kauai so that I could relax, and hike<br>
    However, I have never been to Maui, but I have heard good things about the region from my family.<br>
    I hope to return soon</p>


<!--Fifth Place-->
<h2>#5: <span><strong>Alaska (Kenai Pennisula)</strong></span></h2>
<p>This summer, I went all over the state of Alaska, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, all the way down to Seward.<br>
However, I want to explore more of the Kenai Pennisula since there is more hiking, tourism and exploring to do. <br>
I can't wait to return there!!!</p>
