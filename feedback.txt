Nice work getting the app up.  A few observations:

* In general, package folders like node_modules should
  not be checked into git. Instead, add them to a file
  called .gitignore.  (See the example I added to your
  repo.)

* There is nothing wrong with your approach to sending
  files; but, if you prefer, you can tell Express to
  automatically send static files in a specific directory:
     app.use(express.static('public'));

* I added two files to your express directory: fly.toml and
  Dockerfile. Once you have these two files, all you need
  to do to deploy an Express app is run
     fly launch
  To update an app, you run
     fly deploy
  (Remember to customize the files before using them on a new
   app.)
